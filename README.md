# R Deep Learning Cookbook
This is the code repository for [R Deep Learning Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/r-deep-learning-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787121089), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Deep Learning is the next big thing. It is a part of machine learning. It's favorable results in applications with huge and complex data is remarkable. Simultaneously, R programming language is very popular amongst the data miners and statisticians.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
[default]
 exten => s,1,Dial(Zap/1|30)
 exten => s,2,Voicemail(u100)
 exten => s,102,Voicemail(b100)
 exten => i,1,Voicemail(s0)
```

A lot of inquisitiveness, perseverance, and passion is required to build a strong background in data science. The scope of deep learning is quite broad; thus, the following backgrounds is required to effectively utilize this cookbook: 
 * Basics of machine learning and data analysis
 * Proficiency in R programming
 * Basics of Python and Docker
Lastly, you need to appreciate deep learning algorithms and know how they solve complex problems in multiple domains
